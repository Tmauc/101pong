# 101pong
First mathematics project of the TEK1.
The goal of this project is to make the calculations of the bounces of the ball and to create our game in ASCII.

# USAGE
```bash
./101pong x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 n
DESCRIPTION
x0 ball abscissa at time t - 1
y0 ball ordinate at time t - 1
z0 ball altitude at time t - 1
x1 ball abscissa at time t
y1 ball ordinate at time t
z1 ball altitude at time t
n time shift (greater than or equal to zero, integer)
```
Or go into the interfacegraphique folder :
```bash
./101pong2D 
```
